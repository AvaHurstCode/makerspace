# Basic Access to CODE maker space

The maker kitchen is an open space for all code students to enjoy and experiment with. Gaining experience in all kinds of material and microelectronic processes and digital fabrication techniques. Due to the combination of expensive, delicate tools, complex processes, and potentially hazardous or harmful materials, there needs to be a protocol or process to ensure the CODE members' safety and the long and reliable running of the available tools and equipment within the maker kitchen.

To gain basic access please approach your project consultant or course leader and request access be added to your CODE access card account. You will need to read and agree to a basic outline of safety and fair / good use processes and then off you go.

This is suitable for basic fabrication with cutters, tape, glue etc. for physical prototypes and includes soldering and basic microelectronics.

*Clean up after yourself*
Users and staff should clean up and put things away after use as they may become safety  hazards. 
* If a bin is not easily accessible, ask a staff member. 
* Clean up after yourself. It is the responsibility of workshop users to keep the area clean and  tidy.  
* Keep areas around machines and walkways clear. 
* Don’t block or obscure emergency evacuation thoroughfares. 
* Clean down benches, machinery when you have finished or requested to by staff. 
* When you have finished using tools/equipment put it back in its allocated space. 
* If a tool it is broken, blunt, damaged or unsafe to use it is your responsibility to inform staff. 
* If you break or damage tools or equipment it is your responsibility to inform staff. * Do not return or put away damaged tools/equipment without informing staff, as the next  user could be seriously hurt or injured. 

Mess causes multiple Occupational Health issues, such as: 
* Limiting movement, access can create a serious OH issue in case of a fire. 
* Adding to the combustible material and heighten the risk in the event of a fire. 
* Adding to the likely hood of someone being injured by slipping, tripping and falling. 
* Encouraging vermin and rodents. 

Do: 
* Organise your clutter making sure it doesn’t interfere with other operations or process in  the workshops. 
* Clean up after yourself. Dispose of rubbish in allocated bins. 
* Store your items only in the designated areas or lockers outside the maker space.. 
* If you leave anything behind in the designated areas, label it with your name, contact  details, the date you left it and the date you will collect. 

Do not: 
* Place your bags or items in access ways or doorways. 
* Block fire exits or equipment. 
* Leave your clutter expecting someone else will deal with it.

#### No external tools 
Users cannot bring their own power tools. If you need to use machines that are not in the  workshop, check with the staff first. 

#### Damaged machinery 
If a machine is damaged, broken or not operating in the way it should the machine should  be shut down, removed from power and staff notified. 

#### No storage 
The maker Space is not a storage area for models and projects. Only models being worked on can be kept in the workshop space and must be stored in the lockers or designated areas with a completed  label. When the project is not being worked on it must be removed from the maker space.  Items that are not labeled or stored in the appropriate ways will be disposed of. 

#### Think before you act 
CODE staff reserve the rights to revoke access should they find members not abiding the  mentioned rules or are compromising workshop and student safety.

#### Safety Regulations 
In the workshop, picture safety signs use universal symbols to: 
* Prevent accidents signal health hazards indicate the location of safety, first aid and  fire protection equipment 
* Give clear guidance and instruction in emergency procedures 
* Form part of the total safety information system of the area. 
Picture safety signs warn of hazards or risks that are present in the workplace and  inform users in the workplace how to avoid that hazard or risks, or its effects. In  addition to the picture signs, many individual machines and processes have detailed  signs explaining “step by step” instructions to use them safely. 

#### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is a piece of clothing or equipment designed to  protect an individual from risk of injury.maker Space PPE includes: 
* Safety Glasses – must be used for all hand power tools drill 
* Face Shields – Can be used for Dremel drill 
* Gloves – must be used with the hand power tools
* Earmuffs – Can be used  
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is designed to be the last line of defense  between you and a hazard.  


Choosing what PPE to wear depends on what you are doing. For example, if you are  using a piece of machinery it is highly likely you will have to wear safety glasses or  face shield. You should always read the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and  consult staff. Selecting the correct type of PPE for the task is also very important.  walls around the maker Space and within the SOPs for different machines. 
PPE must be worn when indicated by signage. These signs will be found on the  

#### Appropriate Clothing 
The workshops are places where actual items are made and constructed. Because  this can involve manual work using equipment and machinery the wearing of  appropriate clothing is very important. Please be sensible in what you wear in the  workshops. Items like jewelry, loose hair and clothing can be caught in equipment  and machinery resulting in a serious injury. 

Do: 
* Wear sturdy secured clothing that offers you some protection and doesn't matter if it  gets dirty or damaged. 
* Contain and secure long hair and beards to reduce the risk of being caught in  equipment and machinery. 
* Wear appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). 

Do not: 
* Wear your best clothing as it can be damaged or ruined. 
* Wear high heel shoes. 
* Wear flip flops, sandals or open toed shoes. 
* Wear loose fitting clothing. 
* Wear jewelry. 

#### Workshop Equipment : Standard Operating Procedures

Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) are usually a one to two-page document  attached to or near a piece of plant or equipment. They are designed to remind you  of the safe way of using that piece of equipment not to replace instruction manuals or  training. You should always read them before operating any piece of equipment.

* Notify staff immediately if machinery does not appear to be running or operating  properly. 
* Never make adjustments while machinery is running. 
* In case of an electrical power failure, turn off the machinery and stand clear. * Turn off the power and wait until the cutting tool stops turning before leaving any  machinery. 

### Emergency Procedures 
Hazard Identification : 
It is important to be aware of potential hazards. Hazards come in many forms. They  include but are not limited to: 
* Machinery and Tools - punctures, stabs, cuts, abrasions, amputations, etc. * Chemical and Material - poisoning, allergic reactions, etc.
* Manual Handling - sprains, strains, muscle tearing, etc. 
* Slips, trips and falls - bone brakes, head injuries, etc. 
* Environmental, Air Quality and Noise - suffocation, illness, hearing damage, etc. * Ergonomics - repetitive strain injury, carpal tunnel, etc. 
* Biological - disease, contagions, etc. 
* Electrical - shock, burns, etc.
  
In the event of an emergency, please be aware of: 
* The first aid resources available (e.g. location of first aid kit, first aider). * Emergency response arrangements, such as evacuation and assembly area. * How to raise the alarm in the event of an emergency. 

### First Aid Response 
The maker Space contains a first aid kit with a burns kit and eye wash. If you suffer an  injury whilst operating a machine turn the machine off immediately. Initiate treatment  immediately with the first aid kit and notify the staff immediately. A list of First Aid  trained workshop staff can be found on the First Aid box in themaker Space. 

### Fire 
In the event of a fire: 
1. Assist any person in immediate danger only if safe to do so. 
2. Close door to isolate fire. 
3. Raise the alarm if it has not already been done so by staff 
4. Follow instruction from library staff and leave the building calmly and quickly if  instructed to do so. 
5. Evacuate if necessary: leave immediately by the nearest safe exit and go directly to  your assembly area. 
6. At the assembly area (Market Square at the top of the steps), please wait patiently  for further instructions. 

### Evacuation Procedures 
1. Prepare to evacuate. 
2. Fire Marshal will investigate and confirm if evacuation is required. 3. Follow all instructions from Fire Marshals. 
4. Leave immediately by the nearest safe exit and go directly to assembly area (Market  Square above the steps) 
5. At the assembly area, please wait patiently for further instructions Incident Reporting

### Process 
All incidents, injuries or near misses should be formally reported to any workshop  staff. A near miss is an incident that could have had potentially serious  consequences but luckily was avoided. Ask the maker Space Manager if the incident  needs to be reported. 

### Where an incident involves personal injury: 
1. Attend to the injured person. 
2. Contact the nearest first-aider. 
3. Notify emergency services if necessary. 

Report the hazard or incident immediately to the relevant manager. In the case of: 
* User: contact the staff member supervising the activity. 

All hazards, incidents and accidents involving staff, users or property, or other  persons or property for which the Library has a legislative responsibility, must be  reported to supervising staff members. 
Why do these incidents, injuries or near misses need to be reported? We need your  support with this procedure as it will assist us in improving our systems. If we are  unaware that accidents or potential accidents are happening, we cannot improve our  systems and potential hazards remain. Also, certain serious incidents require  immediate notification to staff and if they are not, you and the library could be in  breach of the law. Serious incidents will require investigation and the site should,  where practicable, remain untouched until the investigation has been completed. 

### Penalties : Revocation 
Failure to abide with any of these rules and conditions will be immediately met with  revocation of maker Space use, requiring users to repeat the induction training before  their privileges are restored. In extreme cases (such as: blatant misuse of facilities or  equipment, or endangering another's safety) access will be permanently revoked.
