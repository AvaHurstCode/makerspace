# Maker kitchen access protocol
The maker kitchen is an open space for all code students to enjoy and experiment with. Gaining experience in all kinds of material and microelectronic processes and digital fabrication techniques. Due to the combination of expensive, delicate tools, complex processes, and potentially hazardous or harmful materials, there needs to be a protocol or process to ensure the CODE members' safety and the long and reliable running of the available tools and equipment within the maker kitchen.

First please read the basic [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). All Members are expected to, and undertake to, abide by these basics at all times.

There are a number of levels of access or use that escalate in care required to prevent damage or injury;

* [Basic Access](basic-access.md)
* [3D print access](3dprinter.md)
* [Powered tool access](powertools.md)
* [Laser cutter access](lasercutter.md)
* [Milling Machine access](milling-machine.md)

## Basic Access: Basic access for physical prototyping using not powered tools. [Basic Access](basic-access.md)

To gain basic access please approach your project consultant or course leader and request access be added to your CODE access card account. 
You will need to read and agree to a basic outline of safety and fair / good use processes and then off you go 

This is suitable for basic fabrication with cutters, tape, glue etc. for physical prototypes and includes soldering and basic microelectronics.

## 3D print access [3D print access](3dprinter.md)
You will need to go through the basic access materials as above and then complete a short introduction to safe use of the 3D printer. This includes how and when to access, damage reporting procedures and essential fire and safety information.

## Powered tool access [Powered tool access](powertools.md)
You will need to go through the basic access materials as above and then complete a short orientation on safe use procedure and organisation and clean up for the powered tools in the space.

## Laser Cutter access [Laser cutter access](lasercutter.md)
The XTool laser cutter at CODE contains a high power Class 4 laser - this is considered of the highest safety concern and is the most dangerous of laser devices. Due to the inbuilt safety features, protective case and safety interlocks the XTool cutter is classed in standard operation as a less dangerous Class 1 device. What this means is that providing the machine is operated according to correct safety procedures it is allowable for non-professional use.
Anyone wishing to use the laser cutter must go through the basic maker kitchen access introduction and then complete a short online safety explanation and attend a short safety / access course. 

## Milling machine access [Milling Machine access](milling-machine.md)

* Mandatory Safety Training:
All students must complete a safety training session focused on operating the drill-milling machine. This includes identifying safety hazards, emergency procedures, and using personal protective equipment correctly.

* Hands-on Demonstration:
Students must participate in a supervised hands-on demonstration after the safety training. They will observe safe operation of the machines and practice under supervision.

* Machine Proficiency Test:
Students must pass a practical proficiency test demonstrating their understanding of basic operation, safety protocols, and machine handling before using the equipment independently.

* Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
All students must have and correctly wear appropriate PPE, including safety goggles, ear protection, and any additional lab-specific gear, before machine operation.

* Instructor Authorization:
After completing the training and proficiency test, students receive authorization, granting them permission to operate the drill-milling machine unsupervised.

* Sign-in/Sign-out Procedure:
Students must sign in and out of the lab every time they use the equipment, logging the machine used and the duration of use.

* Buddy System:
Students must not operate machines alone; a buddy must always be present for safety reasons.


Failure to follow the basic protocols in safe, fair and clean use of the maker kitchen will mean access privileges must necessarily be revoked for the safe access of other CODE members.
