# CODE makerspace
The CODE makerspace is a dedicated learning space inside CODE for prototyping and physical making and small scale digital fabrication in the spirit of fablabs and maker kitchens across the world.

It is open for all member of CODE but due to the nature of materials, tools and processes there are some important considerations that must be taken on board, above and beyond other open access learning spaces with in the CODE campus.

## [Access](access.md)
The maker kitchen is an open space for all code students to enjoy and experiment with. Gaining experience in all kinds of material and microelectronic processes and digital fabrication techniques. Due to the combination of expensive, delicate tools, complex processes, and potentially hazardous or harmful materials, there needs to be a protocol or process to ensure the CODE members' safety and the long and reliable running of the available tools and equipment within the maker kitchen. 
* First please read the basic [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). All Members are expected to, and undertake to, abide by these basics at all times. 
* Then [Find out more about access to the space here](access.md)

## Shortt term project storage
An interim solution for project storage has been worked out with the kind support of the campus team. 
This will be under review to see what the needs and capacities are and how it might be improved over time

You can request short term (one semester) project storage in;

* a) one of 5 large metal lockers in front of the maker space by the meeting / call booth
* b) one of the project boxes stored on the shelving system in the maker space

These storage spaces are temporary and last until the end of each semester where they will be emptied of all left over projects and made available for future projects on a semester by semester basis.

* You cannot store any hazardous or flammable materials in any of the project storage spaces
* You are solely responsible for materials therein and this includes removed and recycling at the end of projects. You cannot abandon a project or suggest that materials are left behind ‘in case someone else wants to use it’. If you are done with materials please recycle or put components back into use by placing in the appropriate parts bin on the shelves in makerspace.
* If you need storage into next semester you can apply but this is only ion the basis that the project is still active. This is for active projects only and not long term storage or archiving.
* Materials or projects not in allocated boxes will unfortunately be disposed of, so please don’t just leave things lying around. They will not be there when you come back in a few weeks.

To request a storage box please [complete the request form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScnmsmTnjeEC9stPuUM_edkYa8wo4esuY3vf5sEsdVLaM0SOw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## [Equipment](equipment.md)
The makerspace has a variety of equipment suitable for making 
* physical prototypes from low to medium fidelity
* small scale digital fabrication in hard and soft materials
* microelectronics and embedded systems experimentation
* soft material preparation and fabrication
* vinyl cutting
* laser cutting
* 3D additive printing
