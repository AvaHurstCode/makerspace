# Milling Machine

* Mandatory Safety Training:
All students must complete a safety training session focused on operating the drill-milling machine. This includes identifying safety hazards, emergency procedures, and using personal protective equipment correctly.

* Hands-on Demonstration:
Students must participate in a supervised hands-on demonstration after the safety training. They will observe a trained staff member operating the machines and practice under supervision.

* Machine Proficiency Test:
Students must pass a practical proficiency test demonstrating their understanding of basic operation, safety protocols, and machine handling before using the equipment independently.

* Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
All students must have and correctly wear appropriate PPE, including safety goggles, ear protection, and any additional lab-specific gear, before machine operation.

* Instructor Authorization:
After completing the training and proficiency test, students receive authorization from the instructor or lab supervisor, granting them permission to operate the drill-milling machine unsupervised.

* Sign-in/Sign-out Procedure:
Students must sign in and out of the lab every time they use the equipment, logging the machine used and the duration of use.

* Buddy System:
Students must not operate machines alone; a buddy or lab supervisor must always be present for safety reasons.
