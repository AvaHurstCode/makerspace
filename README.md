# CODE makerspace
The CODE makerspace is a dedicated learning space inside CODE for prototyping and physical making and small scale digital fabrication in the spirit of fablabs and maker kitchens across the world.

It is open for all member of CODE but due to the nature of materials, tools and processes there are some important considerations that must be taken on board, above and beyond other open access learning spaces with in the CODE campus.

## [Access](access.md)
The maker kitchen is an open space for all code students to enjoy and experiment with. Gaining experience in all kinds of material and microelectronic processes and digital fabrication techniques. Due to the combination of expensive, delicate tools, complex processes, and potentially hazardous or harmful materials, there needs to be a protocol or process to ensure the CODE members' safety and the long and reliable running of the available tools and equipment within the maker kitchen. 
* First please read the basic [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). All Members are expected to, and undertake to, abide by these basics at all times. 
* Then [Find out more about access to the space here](access.md)

## [Equipment](equipment.md)
The makerspace has a variety of equipment suitable for making 
* physical prototypes from low to medium fidelity
* small scale digital fabrication in hard and soft materials
* microelectronics and embedded systems experimentation
* soft material preparation and fabrication
* vinyl cutting
* laser cutting
