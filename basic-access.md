# Basic Access to CODE maker space

The maker kitchen is an open space for all code students to enjoy and experiment with. Gaining experience in all kinds of material and microelectronic processes and digital fabrication techniques. Due to the combination of expensive, delicate tools, complex processes, and potentially hazardous or harmful materials, there needs to be a protocol or process to ensure the CODE members' safety and the long and reliable running of the available tools and equipment within the maker kitchen.

## Basic Access: Basic access for physical prototyping using not powered tools
To gain basic access please approach your project consultant or course leader and request access be added to your CODE access card account. You will need to read and agree to a basic outline of safety and fair / good use processes and then off you go.

This is suitable for basic fabrication with cutters, tape, glue etc. for physical prototypes and includes soldering and basic microelectronics.
