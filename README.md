# CODE makerspace
The CODE makerspace is a dedicated learning space inside CODE for prototyping and physical making and small scale digital fabrication in the spirit of fablabs and maker kitchens across the world.

It is open for all member of CODE but due to the nature of materials, tools and processes there are some important considerations that must be taken on board, above and beyond other open access learning spaces with in the CODE campus.

## Sponsorship

The CODE makerspace has been generously supported by funds from our partners at [Deutsche Telekom](https://www.telekom.com/)
